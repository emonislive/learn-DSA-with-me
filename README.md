Hey there! Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repo! This is where I’m dropping all my C++ DSA code. It’s basically my digital notebook for learning and a go-to spot for quick revision.

## Contents
### Data Structures
- **Stack**
  - [Implementation using STL Vectors](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Data%20Structures/Stack.cpp)
- **Linked List**
  - [Implementation of Single Linked List](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Data%20Structures/Linked%20List.cpp)

### Number Thoery
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) / Highest Common Factor (HCF)**
  - [Implementation using Euclidean Algorithm](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Number%20Theory/GCD.cpp)
- **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**
  - [Implementation using Euclidean Algorithm](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Number%20Theory/LCM.cpp)
- **Fibonacci Series**
  - [Implementation using Iterative Approach](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Number%20Theory/Fibonacci.cpp)
- **Factorial**
  - [Implementation using Iterative Approach](https://github.com/emonislive/learn-DSA-with-me/blob/main/Number%20Theory/Factorial.cpp)

## How to Use
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a separate C++ file with detailed comments explaining the code. You can browse through the files to study and understand each concept.
